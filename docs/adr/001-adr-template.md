# 001: Architectural Decision Record Template

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Writing down architectural decisions allows revision and helps detect errors. A
template to document such a decision allows clarity, consistency and ease of
access.

There are many ADR templates available, as can be found in
[Joel Parker Henderson's collection on GitHub](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record).
There exists a need to select a template which is simple to adopt and provides
the mentioned benefits.

## Decision

For this project,
[Michael Nygard's ADR template format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
is used. It fits the project because it is simple and flexible.

The template consists of four key sections:

1. Status: the current state of the decision (one of Proposed, Accepted,
   Deprecated, Superseded).
2. Context: the issue or situation motivating the decision.
3. Decision: the change being proposed or implemented.
4. Consequences: the positive and negative outcomes resulting from this
   decision.

## Consequences

Positive:

- Consistency
- Ease of access

Negative:

- Migrating templates is not a non-trivial task
